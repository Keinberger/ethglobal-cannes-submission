# üß† The Opinion Market

The **Opinion Market** is a browser-based, on-chain platform where users express their stance on global or controversial topics by staking into real-money liquidity pools. It functions as a **market-driven global sentiment layer** ‚Äî users buy **Yes** or **No** tokens, shifting the market and representing their opinion with capital.

Unlike prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket), there's no resolution or final outcome. Each market is ongoing and reflects the **real-time weight of global belief**. Token prices fluctuate based on an AMM model (like Uniswap) and update on every trade.

All market data is stored on-chain. For the MVP, we simulate this with placeholder data until the real smart contracts are integrated.
