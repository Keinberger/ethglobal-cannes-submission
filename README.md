## OpinionMarket

This is "The Opinion Market", a browser-based, on-chain platform that serves as a **source of truth for ongoing debates**. Users voice their opinions on global or controversial topics by staking capital to support their position. The platform is **focused on debate and opinion expression**, not trading or profit-making.

**Key Distinction**: This is NOT a prediction market or trading platform. It's an **ongoing debate platform** where users can easily voice their opinions with financial backing. There's no resolution or final outcome - debates are continuous and reflect the **real-time weight of global belief**. The financial mechanism ensures opinions have weight and conviction behind them.

**Philosophy**: Instead of focusing on betting or market dynamics, the platform emphasizes making it easy for people to voice their stance on important debates and see the collective sentiment of society.

All debate data is stored on-chain. For the MVP, we simulate this with placeholder data until the real smart contracts are integrated.
